# SOEN 341 - Co-Operation
# Objective
- Develop a job seeking application for students and employers.

# Project
- Searching for a job related to your field can be really difficult as a student. Similarly, employers searching for new proteges to take on also have a really hard time finding the perfect candidate. This web application unifies the whole process by bringing employers and students of all types onto one platform to collaborate more efficiently and effectively. Students will be able to easily find and challenge themselves with the particular job position they desire. Then, once they apply, employers have the leisure of viewing their application along with any extra information the student offers on their profile page. Employers can even take their time and look through all job seeking users and scout for their preferred candidate. It is the ideal application for job seeking internships.
